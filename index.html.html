						<p>Have you ever made a wish in childhood to get a small and fluffy puppy? I think you have. The most of children want their parents to buy them a dog. As for me, I was no exception and as a child I was obsessed with the desire to be a happy owner of a dog. I dreamt about how I would play different games with him, how we would walk together, and I would always know that I have a reliable defender and an active friend. Unfortunately, my dad did not support this idea. He always said that this is a big responsibility, and children sometimes stop caring for a new friend a few weeks after a puppy appears in the family.</p>

		<div class="one"> <p2>  However, many years later, when my brother and I were old enough, my father decided to let us have a new furry family member. And now we are the happy owners of a dog called Archie, who has been living with us for 3.5 years. I can say that it has been a long way from plans to buy a dog to its implementation, the subsequent care of the puppy and the feeling of true friendship now.

 <h3> About my pet </h3>
 <div> <p3> Archie breeds Jack Rassel Terrier, which is supposed to be in the list of the most active and energetic breeds. We heard about this fact, nevertheless, it didn't stop us. Our family wanted to start a more active lifestyle and constant walks with a dog could help us to do more sports. But, honestly saying, Archie's endless energy and persistent desire to do something all the time sometimes exhaust us. Despite this, I started spending much more time outside, moving, and breathing fresh air walking with my pet. </p3> </div>
